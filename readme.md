<h1 id="about">About</h1>
This pagination supports both Message and Interaction this is all handled by the package which works out which method to use depending on which interface is provided, It also adjusts multiple settings and attributes about the function as it goes on depending on information provided making it easy to use and very customisable

### To download the package use
npm
```sh
npm i @acegoal07/discordjs-pagination
```
yarn
```sh
yarn add @acegoal07/discordjs-pagination
```

### Addition info
The interaction pagination supports deferred interactions but you do not need to defer the interaction yourself as the pagination does it automatically if it is not deferred
